This is a relatively small command-line program I wrote over the course of about a week during the summer of 2020.
It allows the user to play a single round of Mastermind utilizing three custom parameters-
the number of digits in the code to be guessed (peg slots), the range of the digits (peg colors), and the number of tries.

If you do not know how Mastermind works, or need a refresher, see the following Wikipedia article:

As stated above, this program is relatively small, and it's not new territory either-
I wrote a similar program in Java for my high school programming final back in 2016. The main purpose of this program was to
allow me to get used to coding in C#, as well as to keep myself sharp and productive between larger projects.
